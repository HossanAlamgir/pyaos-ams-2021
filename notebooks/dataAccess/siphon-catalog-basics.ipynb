    "The main python package we will use to work with THREDDS Catalogs is called Siphon.\n",
    "Siphon can read THREDDS Catalogs, which are xml documents that do one or more of the following:\n",
    "1. reference other THREDDS Catalogs\n",
    "1. expose metadata about a dataset\n",
    "1. describe how to access a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The xml documents themselves can be written by hand, but often they are generated by a server, such as the THREDDS Data Server.\n",
    "They may be read locally from an xml file, or remotely over HTTP.\n",
    "Siphon greatly simplifies the process of reading and using the information contained in xml, allowing users to \"siphon off data\" from a variety of sources."
