    "Using [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/), it is easy to select out subsets of or indexing into your data because of the coordinate information available on xarray's data structures. Unlike simply NumPy arrays, which only allow posititional dimension lookup by integer indexes, xarray also allows specifying dimensions by name (e.g., x=..., y=...) and indexes by labels ('2015-06-02T00:00'). This notebook will give a brief overview of the available options.\n",
